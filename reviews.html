    <h2>Remedy Kitchen</h2>
    <img src="https://flic.kr/p/2hU2pK2">
    <p>Where: Royal Exchnage Arcade, Cross Street</p>
    <p>The Remedy Kitchen is the first free from cafe in Manchester. Serving a gluten, dairy, wheat and refined sugar free menu so you don't feel so guilty after eating pancakes!<p>
    <p>What: Pictured above is the Beetroot Latte, which didn't taste so much like coffee but had a warm wintery feel to it and come on who doesn't like a pink latte. I also ate vegan pancakes with homemade nutella and bananans. Honestly I never knew I needed 'homemade nutella' in my life before. <p>

    <p>The staff at Remedy Kitchen are also super friendly and helpful and the cafe itself has the nicest atmosphere away from the busier cafes in the city<p>
